# covid-19-therapeutics-vaccines
The motivation for this project was to obtain insights from the publicly available CORD-19 dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/)
I chose to take it in the direction of exploring and grouping together potential treatments, vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19. 

I have used Latent Dirichlet Association (LDA), a topic modelling NLP technique to explore the scientific literature and classify the scientific texts. 
This was followed by some exploratory data analysis. I then tried out a  few unsupervised clustering methods such as kMeans, DBSCAN,
hierarchical clustering and LDA and proceeded to compare the results. This was followed by a discussion of key insights and potential directions for 
treatments and vaccines.
